# Welcome to My Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! Here, I share my research, projects, and thoughts on AI, computer vision, and data privacy.

## Postdoc Researcher at [VAP Lab](https://vap.aau.dk/members/) [Aalborg University](https://www.en.aau.dk/)

#### Research Interest: Privacy Preserving Video Anomaly Detection, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Anonymization of images/videos, Ethical and Legal AI.

## Education
- Ph.D.   | Indian Institute of Technology Patna, India							       		
- M.Tech.   | National Institute of Technology Hamirpur, India 			        		

## Work Experience
**Technical Lead at [HCL Software](https://www.hcl-software.com/), India (_July 2023 - April 2024_)**

## Research
<p align="left"> I believe computer vision holds immense potential to assist humankind, especially when applied responsibly. High-dimensional data â€” particularly videos â€” carry complex, nuanced information that often goes untapped. My research centers on developing intelligent algorithms that detect and localize anomalies in video surveillance, with a strong emphasis on preserving personal data privacy.<br><br>
I'm passionate about advancing AI in computer vision, deep learning, and video-based anomaly detection. Beyond technical innovation, I am deeply committed to building systems that align with ethical standards and legal frameworks. My work aims to ensure that AI respects individual rights and supports privacy-preserving practices, addressing concerns around surveillance, consent, and data protection. I advocate for AI that not only performs well but also operates transparently and responsibly in real-world environments.
